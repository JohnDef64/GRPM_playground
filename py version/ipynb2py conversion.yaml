how to convert automatically  a jupyter notebok into a py file that separates cell with %% 
ChatGPT
To automatically convert a Jupyter Notebook into a Python script (.py) file while separating the cells with %%, you can use the nbconvert library, which is a part of Jupyter ecosystem. Here's how you can do it:

Install nbconvert if you haven't already done so. You can use pip to install it:
shell
Copy code
pip install nbconvert
Once you have nbconvert installed, you can use the --to script option to convert the Jupyter Notebook to a Python script. By default, it will separate the cells with # %% comments. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook (e.g., example.ipynb) is located. Then run the following command:
shell
Copy code
jupyter nbconvert --to script example.ipynb
This command converts the Jupyter Notebook file example.ipynb into a Python script file named example.py. Each cell will be separated with a comment line # %%.

Note: Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and added to your system's PATH variable for the jupyter command to work.

Once the conversion is complete, you can open the generated .py file in your favorite text editor or IDE to view and work with the separated code cells.
